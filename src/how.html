	Minesweeper is a single player puzzle video game.
	<br>  
	The objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines without detonating them.<br> 
	The player is initially presented with a grid of unknown squares. 
	<br> 
	Some random squares, unknown to the player, contain mines. 
	<br> 
	The size and difficulty is choosen by the player beforehand. 
	<br> 
	The game is played by clicking/selecting a square. 
	<br> 
	If the square contains a mine, the game is lost. 
	<br> 
	If no mine, a number is displayed of how many adjacent mines are near the square selected. 
	<br> 
	If no mines are adjacent, the square is blank. 
	<br> 
	Using this number, the player has to avoid mines to select every last non-mine square.
